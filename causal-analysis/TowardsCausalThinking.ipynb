    "The goals are very different here. It is not about estimating the size of ACM Hub in a greenfield application. Now we have a running ACM hub. A set of managed clusters are connected to it. And a set of ACM features like GRC, Observability are enabled. Question to answer is - is my system approaching some kind of limit which may not manifest itself simply in CPU, Memory consumption. It may be responding slower, it may be dropping data or there could be other manifestations. The question `do we need to add more capacity` can be approached now with much more details. We never had the luxury of those details when we sized for green field.\n",

And those sub system healths inform us about the overall health. These functions that derive a sub system health could be a regression model, it could be a classification model or it could be a simple if-then-else statement. But we are basical building a causal model here from bottoms up. Stated another way, we again approach by trying to model the system through a set of equations. But here the `dependent variables` and `independent variables` are strongly causally related.\n",
